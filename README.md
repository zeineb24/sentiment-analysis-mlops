# End-to-End Sentiment Analysis MLOps Pipeline (GCP)

This repository implements a **production-style end-to-end MLOps pipeline** for sentiment analysis using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.  
It covers data preprocessing, model inference, CI/CD, batch prediction, and explainability, following modern MLOps best practices.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a machine learning model can be:
- trained and containerized,
- deployed as a scalable API,
- integrated into a **batch data processing pipeline**,
- monitored and tested using CI/CD,
- and explained using **XAI techniques**.

This project was built as part of an advanced MLOps workflow and reflects real-world ML system design.
